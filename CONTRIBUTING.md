## Adding a New Video
1. Fork the repository  
2. Add your video entry in the correct place  
3. Open a Pull Request  

When you create the PR, GitHub will provide a template. Please fill it out completely:  
- **Video title**  
- **YouTube link**  
- **Category / tool covered**  
- **Why it’s a good fit**  

Make sure your submission follows these rules:  
✅ Practical, step-by-step tutorial  
✅ Shows how to use a specific Bitcoin tool  
❌ Not just an interview, podcast, or broad explainer

## Other Contributions
If your pull request is **not about adding a video** (e.g., fixing typos, improving design, code changes), simply describe the change clearly in your PR.  

---

## Pull Request Templates
- If we are using **one general template**, just skip the “Video Submission” section if your PR is unrelated.  
- If we are using **multiple templates**, choose either:
  - **“Add Video”** (for new tutorials)  
  - **“General”** (for everything else)
